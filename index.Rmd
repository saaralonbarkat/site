I am an academic researcher of Public Administration and Public Policy. I am an assistant professor at [at the school of Political Sciences at the University of Haifa](https://poli.hevra.haifa.ac.il/index.php?option=com_sppagebuilder&view=page&id=3&Itemid=539&lang=en). 

My main research interest is in the interrelations between modern government bureaucratic organizations and their external audiences, and their implications for democracy. I am currently conducting a research project where I study citizens' undervaluation of government services and its link to stereotypical negative associations of public sector organizations (ISF grant 1855/22). In addition, I am interested the use of AI algorithms in the public sector, and its implications on the dynamics of bureaucratic decision making and discretion as well as the nature of citizen-government relations.  

I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2019. Thereafter, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University. 

I am a methodological pluralist. I also employ in my studies a variety of additional empirical approaches, including experimental designs, observational analyses of administrative data, qualitative case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of interviews.
